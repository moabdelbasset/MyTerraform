# MyTerraform 
This is my first example using Terraform on OCI. The example was to create a new webserver.
The design was very simple to test my Terraform coding skills

Notes:

- I have no access to DHCP services with  my account.
- I have updated the setup_TF_vars.sh with needed info.
- I don't have the privilege to create a compartment. I had to use the created one.
